## Contextual Inquiry

A contextual inquiry is an interview where we sit with a user and watch their daily activities, like shadowing. 

We don't want to determine if they are right or wrong in how they do things, just understand how and why they behave in some ways.

Contextual research is the process of observing real user behavior in order to generate design insights. We do this to understand what people do, why they do it, and how they feel about it, and to empathize with people who are not like us.

<br>

How do we conduct contextual research?

While there are a variety of techniques for conducting contextual research, we’ll primarily focus on contextual inquiry. During a contextual inquiry, we’ll often start with a semi-formal interview before we move into observing users in their natural environment trying to do something. 

In the interest of time, we’ll have them focus on doing things that pertain to our research focus, but there is tremendous value in watching what our users do before and after they engage in tasks we’d like them to do. This is where we can find truly innovative material.

<br>

A contextual inquiry includes the following steps:

> Preparation  
> Research  
> Findings  

<br>
<br>

## Preparation

Before we even think about talking to a user, we need to make sure we’re prepared to do so.

To make sure we don’t forget anything, it helps to follow a checklist. 

We’ll use the following list for our preparation:

> Is my equipment ready?  
> What video/audio recording equipment do I need?  
> Do I have tapes/memory cards?  
> Do I have batteries (and backup batteries)?  
> Do I have pens/paper?  
> Do I have a digital camera?  
> Is my script ready?  
> Do I have questions?  

<br>

Have a list of questions you desire to have answered and try to anticipate the flow of the inquiry. Be open to following the direction the work takes you.

> Is my consent form ready?  
> What roles & responsibilities will everyone have?  


Whether you’re working on a team or solo, you’ll need to make sure you have these roles covered. On a team, you can delegate each of them to separate individuals. When you’re flying solo, you’re on the hook for all of them.

<br>

### Moderator
Establishes rapport, makes the participant comfortable and keeps the conversation on track.

Keys to moderation:

> Be the primary point of communication.  
> Be conversational, but not chatty.  
> Ask 1 question at a time.  
> Be patient; count to 5.  
> Ask open-ended questions.  
> Ask “why,” even if you know the answer.  
> Summarize, interpret and reference.  

<br>

### Audio/Videographer, Photographer

Visually documents everything. Responsible for all audio being recorded and of quality. Makes sure everything is backed up, charged, etc.

Keys to capturing audio, video, photo:

> Know your equipment.  
> Get your settings in check beforehand.  
> Shoot from the hip!  
> Take a portrait.  
> Over-shoot.  
> Back-up every day.  

<br>

### Note Taker

Captures everything that’s happening in the environment and the conversation. Is accountable for all data.

Keys to note-taking:

> Capture everything (within focus).  
> Support the moderator.  
> Capture direct quotes.  
> Differentiate your thoughts from the data.  
> Document a full piece of data - Work flow & tasks that you observe  
> Work opportunities and problems  
> Tools used  
> Design ideas, and validation  

<br>
<br>

## Conducting Research

Now that we’re prepared, we’re ready to start our research. 

Once we get in the room with a user, the basic flow of our contextual inquiry session is as follows:

>Introduction  
>  
>Introduce yourself  
>  
>Explain informed consent form, receive signature  
>  
>Get permission to record, and then start recording  
>  
>Articulate your focus  
>  
>Observe work and interpret  
>  
>Remember your roles  
>  
>Follow your focus; draw the user towards your foci questions  
>  
>Interpret and get validation  
>  
>Ask to try things  
>  
>Don’t judge  
>  
>Wrap-up  
>  
>Summarize your understandings  
>  
>Thank the user  
>  
>Leave the door open for future meetings  

<br>
<br>

## Organizing Findings

Directly after the inquiry, in your team (when possible), meet and regroup; discuss the inquiry, and document key takeaways:

> How did you feel about the session? Good? Surprised? Confused?  
> What were the top three things you learned that you weren’t expecting?  
> What were the top three problems you saw, or opportunities for design to positively impact change?  
> Send a thank-you note to the participant (if possible), and confirm that you may contact them again in the future.  
> Create a transcript with timestamps. There are services that’ll do this for you, but you’ll learn more doing this yourself.

## Recording Interviews

Why should we record interviews?

Having a recording allows us to review our research and extract insights we missed in the moment.

How do I record an interview?

There are a number of ways to record an interview. Most smartphones have apps for recording audio. But, you’ll typically get a higher quality recording with a dedicated recorder. 

We tend to record audio because it is less intrusive, but a video recording is more useful because we can capture body language and facial expressions.

Regardless of the method you choose, you need to make sure you’ve had ample practice with your equipment and plenty of backup parts.

And *always* ask for permission to record the interview. If the interviewee says no, have someone help with note taking or prepare to take notes yourself.

<br>

## Asking Open Questions

What is an open question?

An open question is a question that cannot be answered with a yes or no, or other static response.

### Why should we ask open questions?

Yes/no questions don’t tell us enough! We want to learn more about how the user thinks, behaves, interacts, etc. To do so, we need to hear more about their internal thought process and rationale.

### How do I ask open questions?

> Do you like this?   
vs. 
> Can you tell me your feelings about this?  


> You don’t like this, right?   
vs. 
> How does this make you feel?  

Participants can easily answer things they know about:

> What they do  
> How they do things  
> Their opinions about their current activities  
> Their complaints about their current activities  
> How much they like or dislike something they know about, as compared to another thing they know about  

### Successful Interview Techniques

Successful techniques for interviewing include:

> Repetition/Rephrase (So what you mean is..)  
> Ask for an example (Can you show me an example?)  
> Determine steps in a sequence (What do you do next?)  
> Question a term or concept (When you say ‘doohikie’, what do you mean?)  
> Summarize what was said and draw out a conclusion or a concept (So what you are saying is… is that right?)  
> Question pronoun references (Who is “She” or “Bob”?)  
> Ask for anecdotes & stories; check for deviant cases (Can you remember a situation where that didn’t work?)  


<br>

## Informed Consent

What is informed consent?

Informed consent is a process for getting permission to conduct user research with a user. 

We start by explaining any compensation that will occur, the scope of the study, how the study results will be used, and exactly how their name, image, and words will be used. 

If the user understands all of these considerations, then they can provide their consent and the interview can begin.


### Why do we need it?

We collect informed consent to protect both the user and ourselves. 

By spelling out all of the details in advance, our users can feel comfortable with participating in the research and they can understand how their participation will be used going forward. 

On our side, we avoid any misunderstandings surrounding compensation or the use of their participation by ensuring the user is informed about all of the details of the study.


### How to Collect Informed Consent

We typically try to collect informed consent in writing. This way we have a record of the user’s consent, and we can easily share it with them.

When we collect consent, we’ll want to make sure we make two copies. We’ll keep a signed copy and the user can take home the other copy for their records. This way they can always refer to what they’ve agreed to do.

As we mentioned earlier, informed consent should explain any compensation that will occur, the scope of the study, how the study results will be used, and exactly how their name, image, and words will be used.

All of these details should be covered in your informed consent form.

In a corporate setting, these forms can be provided by your company’s legal department. 

However, you won’t always have that resource. In that case, find a good template that you like online and customize it to fit your needs.

## Leaving the Office

No matter how good we are at design, we will never be able to design a product if we don’t understand our users. To truly understand them, we need to leave our office and go observe them in their own environments.


At first, it may seem scary or intimidating to leave our offices. That’s perfectly natural, and it stems from our desire to be in control. 

In an office, we’re in control of the narrative we’re designing. But, when we step into the field, our ideas can be challenged and disproven.


The first time this happens, it can be a little embarrassing. 

How could I be so blind to my users? But, this is why we want to meet our users. We want to be challenged and proven wrong because then we can start getting things right.


As Jon Kolko explains, our users might…

>> “come from a different socio-economic background, have different ideals and values, behave in unique ways, and most likely, don’t think about design. By observing people in the real context of their real work, [we] come to understand and respect these differences…” This understanding shapes our work and helps us develop the empathy we need to champion “their perspectives, wants, and needs throughout the [design] process.”

<br>
<br>

## Leave Your Knowledge Behind

As designers, we’re intimately involved in our work. Because of that closeness, it is difficult for us to take a step back and receive feedback about it.

Furthermore, since we’re conducting research, we might have some assumptions about how a user should behave. 

These assumptions are extremely dangerous because they prevent us from listening to the users who are right in front of us when we’re interviewing them. 

They make us tune out any new information that doesn’t align with our previous research, and they can even encourage us to lead a user to say something that doesn’t match their experience but does match our biases.

<br>

When we’re conducting research, we need to learn to check our knowledge at the door before we talk to users.

The purpose of an interview isn’t to prove or disprove our hypotheses, it’s to learn about how an individual is dealing with a particular problem. 

Once we’ve conducted a number of interviews, we can step back and look for patterns to support our hypotheses. 

But, when we’re conducting the interview, we’re trying to extract raw, organic insights into a user’s thought process, ideas, motives, needs, wants, fears, etc.

<br>

As we interview users, we need to leave our knowledge at the door and let the user describe their life from their point of view. 

This is an extremely difficult thing to do. As humans, we naturally want to connect with other people and share about ourselves. Over time, it becomes easier to divest your knowledge from an interview.

In the meantime, make sure you are practicing active listening, have a script with guiding questions, and stay focused on the person in front of you instead of your research goals.
